* if there's compatch true we should notify user if he has dependencies that are loaded
* add way to specify incompatible mods
* add steam data dependencies
* allow modders to define info about files like (warnings,errors,infos when something overwrites them)
* provide way for authors to only write their rules, and we somehow should merge them alongside community rules
